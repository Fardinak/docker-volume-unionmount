# Docker Union Mount Volume Plugin
This is a docker plugin that facilitates creating union mounts as docker volumes by taking advantage of docker's graph driver.
It's mostly useful in testing/staging/review areas where having the latest production data and being able to manipulate it, in a carefree manner, is necessary to test features and migrations.

Supported filesystems are:
* AUFS
* Overlay

## Installation
Using `go get`:
```
$ go get -u http://github.com/Fardinak/docker-volume-unionmount
```

## Usage
1. Run the daemon
```
$ docker-volume-unionmount
```
	Available options:
	- `-root` is the root directory for union mount driver's operations and volumes _(defaults to /var/lib/docker-volumes/\_unionmount/)_
	- `-defaultfs` is the default filesystem for this driver's volumes _(defaults to docker's storage driver or `aufs`)_

2. Create a named volume with the driver
```
$ docker volume create --driver unionmount -o layers=/path/to/newer/clone:/var/lib/postgresql/data pgsandbox_data
```
	Available options:
	- `layers` absolute path to layers of the union, from top to bottom, separated by colons `:`. The upper layer will be automatically generated by the driver. **(Required)**
	- `filesystem` is the filesystem for this volume _(defaults to driver's `-defaultfs` option)_

3. Use the volume in one or more containers
```
$ docker run -it --rm -v pgsandbox_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:latest psql
```

## TODOs
- [ ] Filesystems as separate drivers (perhpase use docker's own `graphdriver` library)
- [ ] Support multilayer with Overlay
- [ ] Support Overlay2
- [ ] Logging (logrus) and Debugging mode

Also: Review mounting other named volumes as layers to a union
